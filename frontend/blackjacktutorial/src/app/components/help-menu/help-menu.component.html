          <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
          <p>
            Blackjack is a popular card game that is played in casinos worldwide. The goal of the game is to beat the
            dealer's hand without going over 21 points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each player is dealt two cards.</li>
            <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
            <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.</li>
            <li>An Ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for the hand.</li>
            <li>The player can choose to "Hit" to receive additional cards or "Stand" to keep their current hand.</li>
            <li>If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "Bust" and lose the round.</li>
            <li>After the player's turn, the dealer reveals their second card and follows specific rules for drawing cards.</li>
            <li>The dealer must draw cards until they have a hand value of at least 17.</li>
            <li>If the dealer's hand exceeds 21 points, they "Bust," and all remaining players win.</li>
            <li>If the dealer does not bust, the hands are compared, and the closest hand to 21 points wins.</li>
            <li>If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, the player wins and receives a payout.</li>
            <li>If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 or the player busts, the dealer wins.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember, the key to Blackjack is to get as close to 21 points without going over. Good luck and have fun!
